        <h2>The insidious eighth album from the reigning master of synthmetal.  MASTER BOOT RECORD's surprise "Virus.DOS" released on October 2nd, 2018. </h2>

        <p>The best in synth-metal! Master Boot Record combines the ever present drone of mechanie and synth that we experience in our every day lives into a hyperactive orchestral soundscape. Listen to it to relax, to drive, to work. Experience waves of nostalgia as the sound of analog electronics beeping out a computerized symphony spirit you away to a realm of technologyical wonders.</p>
